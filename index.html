            This work is a search for a bird in the sky.  <br><br>
            
            <i>  "Its only when the camera becomes birdlike, the bird humanlike, and the human cameralike, an entanglement is possible" </i> <br><br>

            <p style="text-align: left">
            The object you are holding, where you are reading this text, there is an eye in that device. It is looking for a bird in the sky. You have to help the machine see the bird and when it does, it will detect the bird. <br>
            We see this as a performance. The moment of entanglement between the time of the day, the weather on that day, the population of birds, the location of seeing the work, your body, the many birds that have come before that have trained the machine-learning model and your network connection is the performance. When this loop closes, a few lines appear. 
            We see this as a performace.
             
            <br><br>
        
            The texts we have seleceted, the autors of these texts, their lives and the non humans that they have encountered, all these together make a story of which we imagine ourselves to be a part of. And now by reading this text, you too are inevitably part of this performance. 
           <br> It is to see this text that we make this work in performance with you. 
            The generated text is a tribute to the many thinkers and doers who we admire. They have been telling the story of the whole world differently by a telling where the mind and body are not seperate.
